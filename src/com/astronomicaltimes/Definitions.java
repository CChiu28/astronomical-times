				+ "end and beginning of nighttime respectively. To the naked eye, it may be difficult to distinguish the "
				+ "difference between astronomical twilight and night time. Most stars can be seen during this phase.\n\n"
				+ "Nautical Twilight: This is the period of twilight when the sun's geometric center is 6-12 degrees below "
				+ "the horizon. The horizon is faintly visible during this time and brighter stars are still visible, making "
				+ "it possible to navigate at sea, hence the name nautical twilight. Nautical dusk marks the beginning of astronomical twilight "

				+ "It marks the period of time just before the sunrise and immediately after sunset."

				+ "given the location's local meridian. It usually doesn't occur at 12:00. The poles also do not experience "
				+ "solar noon because they do not have a meridian the sun crosses.\n\n");
